# Bug Report

## Problem

The following issues were identified in the code:

- The Decision module was unable to access data from the Perception and Memory components, resulting in incomplete or incorrect decision-making.
- Tool output memory was not being saved properly, which prevented the Decision module from accessing relevant information even after it was passed.
- The Decision prompt templates contained incorrect examples, which negatively affected the system's ability to generate correct responses.

## Solution

- The data flow between the Perception, Memory, and Decision modules was reviewed and corrected to ensure that the Decision module can reliably access information from both Perception and Memory.
- The mechanism for saving tool output memory was fixed, ensuring that all relevant outputs are persisted and accessible for future decision steps.
- The Decision prompt templates were updated with accurate and relevant examples, improving the quality and correctness of the system's generated decisions.
