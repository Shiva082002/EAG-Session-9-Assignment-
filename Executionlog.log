Development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename\\n\\n*Project A*in 2019; the game was released on June 2, 2020 for Windows. It was ported to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in June 2024, albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients.\\n\\n## Gameplay\\n\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Valorant_gameplay.jpg/250px-Valorant_gameplay.jpg]\\n\\n*Valorant* is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.[4][5][6][7] Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world.[7] In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a \\"classic\\" pistol and one or more \\"signature ability\\" charges.[5] Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.[8][9] There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately.[9] As of February 2024[update], the game offers 26 agents to choose from.[3][10][11] Five agents are unlocked at account creation, with the rest unlocked using an in-game currency called Kingdom Credits. Kingdom Credits can be acquired by playing games or completing daily and weekly tasks, and can be spent on unlocking new agents or cosmetic items. However, within the first 28 days of release, new Agents can only be unlocked with Valorant Points (VP), Agent Recruitment Events, or by having a linked and active Xbox Game Pass subscription. VP is an in-game currency that can only obtained by purchasing it with real money,[12][ better source needed] and it can be spent on cosmetic items or new agents.\\n\\n### Unrated\\n\\nIn the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point.[5] If the defending team can deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team receives a point.[13] If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point.[5] If both teams win 12 rounds, sudden death occurs, in which the winning team of that round wins the match, differing from overtime for competitive matches. Additionally, if after 4 rounds, a team wishes to forfeit that match, they may request a vote to surrender. If the vote reaches 4 (in contrast to 5 for competitive), the winning team gets all the victory credit for every round needed to bring them to 13, with the forfeiting team receiving losing credit.[14] A team gets only three chances to surrender: once in the first half, once in the pistol round of the second half, and once more in the second half.\\n\\n### Spike Rush\\n\\nIn the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, as well as multiple different power-up orbs.[15]\\n\\n### Swiftplay\\n\\nSwiftplay matches are simply a shortened version of the Unrated game mode. 10 players are split into 2 teams, attackers and defenders. Attackers must plant the spike while the Defenders must stop them. What differs Swiftplay to Unrated is that it is best to 9 rounds - the first team to win 5 rounds wins the match. On round 4, the team\'s players switch, as they would do in round 7 in the Unrated game mode. The game\'s currency system has no changes from Unrated. Swiftplay is meant as a quick game mode, averaging around 15 minutes per game, as opposed to around 40 minutes for Unrated.[16]\\n\\n### Competitive\\n\\nCompetitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Players are required to reach level 20 before playing this mode.[17][ better source needed] In July 2020, Riot introduced a \\"win by two\\" condition for competitive matches, where instead of playing a single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing rounds on attack and defense in overtime until a team claims victory by securing a two-match lead. Each overtime round gives players the same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as approximately half of their ultimate ability charge. After each group of two rounds, players may vote to end the game in a draw, requiring 6 players after the first set, 3 after the second, and thereafter only 1 player to agree to a draw. The competitive ranking system ranges from Iron to Radiant. Every rank except for Radiant has 3 tiers.\\n\\n[18]\\n\\n[Radiant is reserved for the top 500 players of a region, and both Immortal and Radiant have a number associated to their rank allowing players to have a metric in which they can compare how they rank up to others at their level.\\n\\n*better source needed*][19]\\n\\n### Premier\\n\\nPremier is a 5v5 gamemode that allows players a path-to-pro competitive game mode that is aimed towards players that wish to be a professional player. Premier was first introduced in alpha testing in Brazil before being rolled out worldwide by 2024. Players will need to create a team of five to compete against other teams in divisions. Each season will last a few weeks and the top teams will be invited to compete in the Division Championship, with winning teams able to be promoted to their region\'s Challengers league and therefore be part of the VCT ecosystem. This gamemode includes a pick-and-ban system for maps unlike all the other gamemodes where the players have to play the map selected by the system.[20]\\n\\n### Deathmatch\\n\\nThe Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020.[21][ better source needed] 14 players enter a 9-minute free-for-all match and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the match. The players will spawn with a random agent, equipped with a max shield and an infinite supply of credits to buy any weapons from the buy menu. All abilities are disabled during the match, which indulges pure gunplay.\\n\\n[22]Green health packs drop on every kill, which reset the player to maximum health, armor, and replenish the ammunition in each of their guns.\\n\\n[23]\\n\\n### Team Deathmatch\\n\\nThe Team Deathmatch gamemode was announced on June 15, 2023, and went live on June 27 with patch 7.0. This gamemode combines and borrows elements from the standard unrated mode as well as the regular deathmatch mode. It is a free-for-all gamemode where players are split into two teams with five players each. Each match lasts for 9 minutes and 30 seconds, and the first team that reaches 100 kills win. If neither team has reached 100 kills at the end of the 9.5 minutes, then the team with the most kills wins. Each match is split into four stages, with the weapon selection becoming progressively more powerful as players advance through the stages. Players are respawned in a spawn room after being killed. where they will be able to select and adjust their weapons loadout if needed. Unlike the regular deathmatch mode, players need to select their agents before the match begins, as agent abilities are allowed in this gamemode. Players can charge their agents\' ultimate abilities either by acquiring Ultimate Orbs spawned randomly throughout the map, or by getting kills. Their ultimate abilities will be available for use after their ult percentages reach 100%. Unlike all other gamemodes, this mode is not played on the standard maps, but rather on its own set of three maps that are specifically designed for team deathmatch: Piazza, District, and Kasbah.[24]\\n\\n### Escalation\\n\\nThe Escalation gamemode was introduced on February 17, 2021[25][ better source needed] and is similar to the \\"gungame\\" concept found in\\n\\n*Counter-Strike*and\\n\\n*Call of Duty: Black Ops*, though it is team-based rather than free-for-all with 5 players on each team. The game will pick a random selection of 12 weapons to move through. As with other gungame versions, a team needs to get a certain number of kills to advance to the next weapon and the weapons get progressively worse as the team moves through them.\\n\\n[26]There are two winning conditions, if one team successfully goes through all 12 levels, or if one team is on a higher level than the opposing team within 10 minutes. Just like Deathmatch, players spawn in as a random agent, unable to use abilities, as the gamemode is set for pure gun fights. Though, abilities like Sova\'s shock darts, Raze\'s boom bot, and rocket launcher, are abilities that everyone gets to use as a weapon. After a kill, green health packs drop, which replenishes the player\'s health, armor, and ammo to its maximum. The gamemode also has auto respawns on, respawning players in random locations around the map.\\n\\n[27]\\n\\n[\\n\\n*better source needed*]### Replication\\n\\nThe Replication gamemode went live on May 11, 2021.[28][ better source needed] During the agent select, players vote on which agent they would want to play as. At the end of the time, or after everyone has voted, the game randomly selects one of the player\'s votes. The entire team will then play as that agent, even if one of the players has not unlocked that agent. It is a best of nine, with the players switching sides after the fourth round. Players can buy guns and shields with a pre-set number of credits. Abilities are pre-bought. Weapons and shields are reset every round. This gamemode was removed in patch 7.0.\\n\\n[29]\\n\\n[\\n\\n*better source needed*][30]\\n\\n### Snowball Fight\\n\\nSnowball Fight was a limited-time gamemode that was released on December 15, 2020, and is only available during Christmas season.[31] It is a Team Deathmatch game mode, with 50 kills to win. Abilities are not allowed to be used, and players spawn in as a random agent. The only weapon available is the snowball launcher, which is an instant kill, but slow, and uses a projectile-based arc. There is infinite ammo. Throughout the game a \\"portal\\" will spawn, delivering gifts, which each contain a random power up.[32][ better source needed]\\n\\n## Agents\\n\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Valorant_cover.jpg/250px-Valorant_cover.jpg]\\n\\nThere are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. Agents are divided into 4 roles: Duelists, Sentinels, Initiators, and Controllers. Each agent has a different role which indicates how the agent is usually played.\\n\\nDuelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Riot\'s official definition for duelists is \\"self-sufficient fraggers.\\"[33] Duelists mainly create space for their team while entering onto a site, giving their teammates information, and making entering a site easier. Their abilities tend to consist of flashes which blind enemies, and movement-based abilities that allow for them to cover large distances faster than other agents. This type of ability kit allows for duelists to shine best when they are able to catch players off guard and get impact frags. On attack, duelists are most often expected to play forward, leading the attack. They are expected to be in front of everyone to get opening picks on enemies since their abilities often give them a competitive advantage when gunfighting an enemy. On defense, duelists will be holding choke points where enemies try to enter sites. Due to the mobility in their kits, they are able to get a pick and reposition, giving their team a numbers advantage.[34][ better source needed]\\n\\nSentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. Their abilities mainly consist of static \'objects\' that are obstacles to the enemies. These objects can give the team valuable information and/or deal damage. On attack, sentinels can use their abilities to cut off certain parts of the map or set up \'objects\' that can ensure the enemy cannot flank without being noticed. On defense, sentinels can use their abilities to slow enemies from entering a site. This provides valuable time for the sentinels\' team members to come and provide defensive support.[34][ better source needed]\\n\\n[11]\\n\\nInitiators plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions. Initiators\' abilities can consist of flashes but also abilities that can reveal the location of enemies. This information allows for attackers to know where enemies are and make taking a site easier. On defense, initiators can use their abilities to provide information on where the attackers are going, as well as helping their teammates retake a lost site.[34][ better source needed]\\n\\nControllers specialize in \\"slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success.\\"[33] They use their abilities to create coverage or clear out areas of space with crowd control. To help their team enter into enemy territory, their abilities consist of some kind of smoke, as well as molotovs, stuns, or flashes. With their smokes, controllers can control sightlines on the map, making it safer to move through the map without getting seen. On offense, controllers can smoke off certain sightlines and use their crowd control on common defensive spots to force enemies into the open. On defense, controllers can smoke and/or use crowd control on entryways to delay or discourage the enemy team from moving forward.[34][ better source needed]\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n*Valorant* was developed and published by Riot Games, the studio behind *League of Legends*.[35][7] Development started in 2014, within their research and development division.[4] Game director Joe Ziegler is credited with the initial idea of *Valorant* while formulating potential games with other Riot developers.[4] David Nottingham is the creative director for *Valorant*.[4] Trevor Romleski, former *League of Legends*\'s designer and Salvatore Garozzo, former professional player and map designer for *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* are its game designers.[36] Moby Francke, former Valve developer, who has been art and character designer for *Half-Life 2* and *Team Fortress 2*, is the art director.[37][38]\\n\\n*Valorant* was developed with two main focuses: making tactical shooters and e-sports more accessible to new players, and creating a game that would attract a large competitive scene, while solving many of the points of criticism voiced by professional players from games in the genre.[39][40][41] Games aimed at large, active communities and player bases, typically free-to-play games like *Fortnite* or Riot\'s own *League of Legends*, tend to put an emphasis on a wider array of system performance improvements and game stability rather than newer technologies or graphics as a way of making sure they\'re as accessible as possible. In interviews leading up to the game\'s launch, game director Joe Ziegler and producer Anna Donlon said that *Valorant* was made for people playing their first tactical shooter just as much as it was for professional players, and that accessibility of the game was a large priority.[40]\\n\\nRiot chose to develop *Valorant* using Unreal Engine 4, which the development team said would allow it to focus on gameplay and optimizations rather than spending time on core systems.[42][43] To meet the goal of a lower performance barrier so more people could play *Valorant*, the team set notably low minimum and recommended hardware requirements for the game. To reach 30 frames per second on these small requirements, the game\'s engineering team, led by Marcus Reid, who previously worked on *Gears of War 4*, had to make several modifications to the engine. These modifications included editing the renderer using the engine\'s mobile rendering path as base, or reworking the game\'s lighting systems to fit the static lighting that tactical shooters often require, as to not interfere with gameplay.[42] Unreal\'s modern underpinnings also helped to solve many of the issues that Riot set out to solve from other games in the genre, and additional modifications helped to meet the game\'s other goal of creating a suitable competitive environment, including optimizing server performance by disabling character animations in non-combat situations and removing unnecessary evaluations in the hit registration process.[44][40][42] During development, Riot Games made promises to work towards a ping of less than 35 milliseconds for at least 70% of the game\'s players.[45] To accomplish this, Riot promised 128-tick servers in or near most major cities in the world, as well as working with internet service providers to set up dedicated connections to those servers.[45] Due to the increase in internet traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic, Riot has had trouble optimizing connections and ping to their promised levels.[46]\\n\\n### Mobile spin-off\\n\\nOn June 2, 2021, Riot Games announced its plans to develop a mobile version of *Valorant*, which would reportedly be the first step it intends to take to expand the game\'s universe.[47]\\n\\n### Console port\\n\\nOn June 7, 2024, during Summer Game Fest, Riot announced that *Valorant* was to be ported over to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, with a limited beta beginning on June 14. The PS5 and Series X/S versions do not have cross-play with the PC version as the gameplay is tailor-made for the consoles, but inventory and progress will be synced with the PC version.[48]\\n\\n## Release\\n\\n*Valorant* was teased under a tentative title *Project A* in October 2019.[49] It was announced on March 1, 2020, with a gameplay video on YouTube called \\"The Round\\".[7][50][51] The closed beta of the game was launched on April 7, 2020.[49] For a chance to obtain a beta access key, players were required to sign up for accounts with both Riot Games and the streaming platform Twitch and watch related streams.[52] This beta ended on May 28, 2020, with the game being fully released on June 2, 2020.[53]\\n\\nThe limited beta for the console port of *Valorant* opened on June 14, 2024. It will initially be limited to the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan with other regions joining at later dates. Unlike the PC beta, players are only required to sign up for accounts with Riot Games.[48]\\n\\n*Valorant* had a full release on consoles on August 2, 2024.[54]\\n\\n## Reception\\n\\n[Image could not be processed: ] |\\n\\n| Aggregator | Score |\\n|---|---|\\n| Metacritic | 80/100[55] |\\n\\n| Publication | Score |\\n|---|---|\\nGame Informer | 8.5/10[59] |\\nGameSpot | 7/10[57] |\\nIGN | 9/10[56] |\\nThe Guardian | [Image could not be processed: ] [Image could not be processed: ] [Image could not be processed: ] [Image could not be processed: ] [Image could not be processed: ] [58] |\\n\\n*Valorant* has been compared to Valve\'s *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive*, with both games having two teams of five attempting to plant a bomb,[6] and Blizzard Entertainment\'s class-based shooter *Overwatch*, as both games have multiple classes and characters catering to various playstyles.[60]\\n\\nAusten Goslin of *Polygon* praised the beta of *Valorant* describing it as refined and \\"one of the most fun tactical shooters I\'ve played\\".[4] On the first day of its beta launch, *Valorant* amassed the second most concurrent viewers for any game ever on Twitch, with 1.73 million viewers tuning in across dozens of streams. Many of these Twitch streams also had drops enabled, with viewers watching during this beta period in hopes of acquiring a beta game key.[61] Only another title from Riot Games, *League of Legends*, has had more concurrent viewers, when 1.74 million watched the 2019 World Championship final.[62]\\n\\nThe official *Valorant* Discord server has become the second largest gaming and fifth largest community overall on the social platform as of May 2023.[63][64]\\n\\n### Awards\\n\\n| Year | Ceremony | Category | Result | Ref. |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| 2020 | The Game Awards 2020 | Best Esports Game | Nominated | [65]\\n|\\n| Best Multiplayer | Nominated | |||\\n| Best Community Support | Nominated | |||\\n| 2021 | The Streamer Awards 2021 | Stream Game of the Year | Nominated | [66]\\n|\\n| 2022 | The Game Awards 2022 | Best Esports Game | Won | [67]\\n|\\n| The Streamer Awards 2022 | Stream Game of the Year | Nominated | [68]\\n| |\\n| 2023 | Golden Joystick Awards | Best Streaming Game | Won | [69]\\n|\\n\\n### Player behavior\\n\\n*Valorant* has received criticism for its \\"toxic\\", male-dominated voice communication system. Emily Rand of ESPN talked about her negative experience playing on teams using the voice communication function as a female. Rand \\"flat-out [refuses] to use it at all\\" when she is not playing with her friends.[70] Jordon Oloman of *The Guardian* explains how \\"the bad apples among *Valorant*\'s players expect an absurd level of perfection, and the resultant voice-chat criticism is hardly constructive.\\"[58] Furthermore, surveys have shown that 79\\u201380% of players reported to have experienced in-game harassment at some point.[71][72]\\n\\n### Anti-cheat software\\n\\nThe game has been criticized for its anti-cheat software, Riot Vanguard, as it was revealed to run on a kernel driver, which allows access to the computer system. OSNews expressed concern that Riot Games and its owner, Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent, could spy on players and that the kernel driver could be potentially exploited by third parties.[73] However, Riot Games stated that the driver does not send any information back to them, and launched a bug bounty program to offer rewards for reports that demonstrate vulnerabilities with the software.[74][75] The bounty will reward white hat hackers between $25,000 to $100,000 for reports on its vulnerabilities, with the pay being based on the severity of the exploit.[76] Gameplay bugs do not qualify for this bounty.[76]\\n\\n*Valorant* will not run on Windows 11 if the system does not have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 compliant cryptoprocessor and UEFI secure boot enabled, as mandated by Microsoft\'s minimum system requirements for the operating system.[77]\\n\\n## Esports\\n\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Valorant_Champions_%C4%B0stanbul_2022.jpg/250px-Valorant_Champions_%C4%B0stanbul_2022.jpg]\\n\\n*Valorant* has an active esports scene. The highest tier of *Valorant* Esports is run by Riot Games.\\n\\nIn 2020, Riot Games launched \\"First Strike\\", a tournament designed to establish a foundation for an esports scene to be created with the game.[78]\\n\\n### Open-qualifiers era (2021\\u201322)\\n\\nIn November 2020, Riot Games announced the Valorant Champions Tour (VCT), which is a year-long tournament circuit consisting of three levels:\\n\\n- Champions - the world championship\\n- Masters - international competitions in mid-season, divided into many stages\\n- Challengers - regional competitions which are qualifiers for Masters\\n\\nTeams will qualify directly for Champions via top places in Circuit Point Standings of their region, based on results of Challengers and Masters. Teams who are at middle places in Circuit Point Standings will have one more chance to qualify for Champions by winning the Last Chance Qualifiers (North America, EMEA, South America, Asia Pacific).\\n\\n### Partnerships era (2023\\u2013present)\\n\\nIn 2023, Riot Games announced a partner team model for their Valorant Champions Tour.[79] The 30 initial franchised teams played their first LAN tournament at the VCT LOCK//IN at S\\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, which officially marked as the beginning of the VCT 2023 season.[80][81] These partnered teams compete in 4 regional leagues to qualify for Masters and Champions.\\n\\n#### Partner System[82]\\n\\n- Champions - the world championship\\n- Masters - international competitions in mid-season, divided into many stages\\n- International Leagues - four competitions divided by international territory (Americas, China, EMEA, Pacific) which are qualifiers for Masters and Champions\\n\\n#### Non-Partner System[83]\\n\\n- Ascension - four competitions divided by international territory (Americas, China, EMEA, Pacific) which serve as promotion into the International Leagues\\n- Challengers - regional competitions which are qualifiers for Ascension\\n\\n## References\\n\\n**^**Andy Chalk (December 20, 2022). \\"Valorant game director Joe Ziegler leaves Riot for Bungie\\".*PC Gamer*.

Being a golden retriever mix, Cooper should be more* *attracted to the water, but Calli is the one who is always wet from laying in the pool.* - The paragraph, however, has no closure. It just ‚Äústops.‚Äù A lead in and a final sentence are still needed: - *Cooper keeps Calli active and fit with their constant play. They are truly bonded.* **Methods to develop your paragraph** - Use examples and illustrations - Cite data (facts, statistics, evidence, details, and others) - Examine testimony (what other people say such as quotes and paraphrases) - Use an anecdote or story - Define the terms used in the paragraph - Compare and contrast - Evaluate causes and reasons - Examine effects and consequences - Analyze the topic - Describe the topic - Offer a chronology of an event (time segments) **When to start a new paragraph?** - When you begin a new idea or point. - New ideas should always start in new paragraphs. - If you have an extended idea that spans multiple paragraphs, each new point within that idea should have its own paragraph. - To contrast information or ideas. - Separate paragraphs can serve to contrast sides in a debate, different points in an argument, or any other difference. - When your readers need a pause. Breaks between paragraphs function as a short "break" for your readers‚Äîadding these in will help your writing be more readable. - You would create a break if the paragraph becomes too long or the material is complex. # 5 ----- # 04-05-2025 6 34 35 36 37 38 - When you are ending your introduction or starting your conclusion. - Your introductory and concluding material should always be in a new paragraph. - Many introductions and conclusions have multiple paragraphs depending on their content, length, and the writer\'s purpose. **Transitions and signposts** - Two very important elements of paragraphing are signposts and transitions. - Signposts are internal aids to assist readers; they usually consist of several sentences or a paragraph outlining what the article has covered and where the article will be going. - Signposts occur as sentences within an essay indicating to the reader how the essay is structured and how the ideas are arranged. - Transitions are usually one or several sentences that "transition" from one idea to the next. - Transitions can be used at the end of most paragraphs to help the paragraphs flow one into the next. - Transitional words form a link to the previous sentence; they include words such as: also, although, likewise, however, subsequently, therefore, rather, also, again, for example. **5-step process to paragraph development** - Step 1. Decide on a controlling idea and create a topic sentence - Step 2. Explain the controlling idea - Step 3. Give an example (or multiple examples) - Step 4. Explain the example(s) - Step 5. Complete the paragraph‚Äôs idea or transition into the next paragraph\n[Source: englishaa.pdf, ID: englishaa_3]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='achieve unity in this paragraph, the writer should begin a new paragraph when the switch is made from employees to managers. **Coherence** - Coherence is the trait that makes the paragraph easily understandable to a reader. - You can help create coherence in your paragraphs by creating logical bridges and verbal bridges. - Logical bridges - The same idea of a topic is carried over from sentence to sentence. - Successive sentences can be constructed in parallel form. - *e.g. In the first stage, an idea can be generated by using a mind-map and some discussion. In the* *next stage, a clear plan of action can be produced in the form of a list.* - Verbal bridges - Key words can be repeated in several sentences - Synonymous words can be repeated in several sentences - Pronouns can refer to nouns in previous sentences - Transition words can be used to link ideas from different sentences - Example - "Schools should offer courses to help students with the problems of unemployment. Such a course might begin with a discussion of where to find employment, then cover resume writing ----- 15 16 17 18 19 # 04-05-2025 and interviewing. Algebra and history don\'t help students with real-world needs. They are required courses that students aren\'t interested in, and this is frustrating for students who would rather learn about other subjects. If schools offered job-skills courses, students would be well prepared for the difficult task of finding a job once they finish school." - Consider the example given above. In this paragraph, the writer begins with the topic of job-skills courses, but veers off onto the topic of algebra and history before returning to the subject of courses on employment. - As a result, the paragraph is disjointed and difficult to understand. **Topic Sentence** - The topic sentence is a sentence that indicates in a general way what idea or thesis the paragraph is going to deal with. - Although not all paragraphs have clear-cut topic sentences, an easy way to make sure your reader understands the topic of the paragraph is to put your topic sentence near the beginning of the paragraph. - Regardless of whether you include an explicit topic sentence or not, you should be able to easily summarize what the paragraph is about. - Examples - "Many television cartoons contain an unhealthy amount of violence." - Notice that this sentence clearly identifies that the key topic of the paragraph is violence in television cartoons. - It also indicates that the remainder of the paragraph will discuss how much violence cartoons typically contain, and how/why this violence is unhealthy for viewers. - "An increasing number of people in America are enjoying the benefits of organically grown fruits and vegetables." - This topic sentence indicates that the remainder of the paragraph will cover the trend in the United States toward eating organic foods. - The reader can also anticipate learning more in this paragraph about the specific benefits of organic foods. **Adequate development** - The topic (which is introduced by the topic\n[Source: englishaa.pdf, ID: englishaa_1]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='**Classroom Activity** - Prepare a 1.5 page Personal Development Plan for the year 2024 based on SMART Goals - SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely - Paragraph 1: Analysis of Personal Current Situation and Development Needs - Paragraph 2: Timeline of activities - Paragraph 3: Summing up -----\n[Source: englishaa.pdf, ID: englishaa_4]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='sentence) should be discussed fully and adequately. - Again, this varies from paragraph to paragraph, depending on the author\'s purpose, but writers should be wary of paragraphs that only have two or three sentences. - A good rule of thumb to follow is to make sure that a paragraph contains four to five sentences which explain and elaborate on the topic sentence. # 3 ----- 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 - Example - "The topics of leadership and management are both similar to and different from one another in several important ways. To be effective, a manager should be a good leader. And good leaders know how to manage people effectively." - Consider the paragraph given above. - The topic sentence promises to discuss "several" points of comparison and contrast between leadership and management, but the remainder of the paragraph falls short of fulfilling this promise. - Only one point of comparison is raised, and this point is left unexplained. - Several questions remain unanswered: How are leaders different from managers? In what specific ways are the two alike? Why must a manager be a good leader to be effective? Why must good leaders know how to manage people effectively? - To achieve adequate development in this paragraph, these questions should be addressed. - Generally speaking, a paragraph should contain between three and five sentences, all of which help clarify and support the main idea of the paragraph. - When a writer begins a new paragraph, it signals to the reader that the writer is changing thoughts or ideas, or is moving on to discuss a different aspect of a main idea. - Here is an example of a paragraph of stacked sentences that lacks logical and verbal bridges: - *My dogs are named Cooper and Calli. Cooper is a Golden retriever and Akita mix. He is a male.* *Calli is a shepherd, Husky and wolf mix. She is a female. Calli was rescued from the pound. Cooper* *was purchased from a breeder. They are close in age. They play together all the time.* - Revised to incorporate bridges and varied sentence structure, the paragraph would read as follows: - *My dogs, Cooper and Calli, are best friends. Cooper, a male retriever and Akita mix, came from a* *breeder. On the other hand, Calli, a shepherd, husky and wolf mix, was rescued from the pound.* *Because they are close in age, they play together all the time.* - Still, the paragraph lacks adequate development. Adequate development is achieved through details, including facts, description, examples, quotes, analysis, explanation, and evaluation. A more developed paragraph would read like this: # 04-05-2025 4 ----- 28 29 30 31 32 33 # 04-05-2025 - *My dogs, Cooper and Calli, are best friends. Cooper, a male golden retriever and Akita mix, came* *from a breeder. On the other hand, Calli, a shepherd, husky and wolf mix, was rescued from the* *pound. Because they are close in age, they play together all the time. For example, the two dogs* *hunt for mice that are attracted\n[Source: englishaa.pdf, ID: englishaa_2]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='Thus, classification often starts by looking at documents, and finding the significant words in those documents. Our first guess might be that the words appearing most frequently in a document are the most significant. However, that intuition is exactly opposite of the truth. The most frequent words will most surely be the common words such as ‚Äúthe‚Äù or ‚Äúand,‚Äù which help build ideas but do not carry any significance themselves. In fact, the several hundred most common words in English (called stop words) are often removed from documents before any attempt to classify them. In fact, the indicators of the topic are relatively rare words. However, not all rare words are equally useful as indicators. There are certain words, for example ‚Äúnotwithstanding‚Äù or ‚Äúalbeit,‚Äù that appear rarely in a collection of documents, yet do not tell us anything useful. On the other hand, a word like ‚Äúchukker‚Äù is probably equally rare, but tips us off that the document is about the sport of polo. The difference between rare words that tell us something and those that do not has to do with the concentration of the useful words in just a few documents. That is, the presence of a word like ‚Äúalbeit‚Äù in a document does not make it terribly more likely that it will appear multiple times. However, if an article mentions ‚Äúchukker‚Äù once, it is likely to tell us what happened in the ‚Äúfirst chukker,‚Äù then the ‚Äúsecond chukker,‚Äù and so on. That is, the word is likely to be repeated if it appears at all. The formal measure of how concentrated into relatively few documents are the occurrences of a given word is called TF.IDF (Term Frequency times Inverse Document Frequency). It is normally computed as follows. Suppose we have a collection of N documents. Define f ij to be the frequency (number of occurrences) of term (word) i in document j. Then, define the term frequency TF ij to be: f ij TF ij = max k f kj That is, the term frequency of term i in document j is f ij normalized by dividing it by the maximum number of occurrences of any term (perhaps excluding stop words) in the same document. Thus, the most frequent term in document j gets a TF of 1, and other terms get fractions as their term frequency for this document. The IDF for a term is defined as follows. Suppose term i appears in n i of 10 CHAPTER 1. DATA MINING the N documents in the collection. Then IDF i = log 2 (N/n i ). The TF.IDF score for term i in document j is then defined to be TF ij √ó IDF i . The terms with the highest TF.IDF score are often the terms that best characterize the topic of the document. Example 1.4 : Suppose our repository consists of 2 [20] = 1,048,576 documents. Suppose word w appears in 2 [10] = 1024 of these documents. Then IDF w = log 2 (2 [20] /2 [10] ) = log 2(2 [10] ) = 10.\n[Source: ch1n.pdf, ID: ch1n_7]', annotations=None)] isError=False

**Adequate development**
- The topic (which is introduced by the topic sentence) should be discussed fully and adequately. Again, this varies from paragraph to paragraph, depending on the author's purpose, but writers should be wary of paragraphs that only have two or three sentences. A good rule of thumb to follow is to make sure that a paragraph contains four to five sentences which explain and elaborate on the topic sentence.
- Example - "The topics of leadership and management are both similar to and different from one another in several important ways. To be effective, a manager should be a good leader. And good leaders know how to manage people effectively." Consider the paragraph given above. The topic sentence promises to discuss "several" points of comparison and contrast between leadership and management, but the remainder of the paragraph falls short of fulfilling this promise. Only one point of comparison is raised, and this point is left unexplained. Several questions remain unanswered: How are leaders different from managers? In what specific ways are the two alike? Why must a manager be a good leader to be effective? Why must good leaders know how to manage people effectively? To achieve adequate development in this paragraph, these questions should be addressed.
- Generally speaking, a paragraph should contain between three and five sentences, all of which help clarify and support the main idea of the paragraph.
- Still, the paragraph lacks adequate development. Adequate development is achieved through details, including facts, description, examples, quotes, analysis, explanation, and evaluation.

Pi-Rate Island, famous for its pirate lore, was said to hold a long-lost treasure. A-Rate Island, just a short sail away, was popular among wanderers for its breathtaking views and hidden caves. In the small coastal village of Seaside, young Finn was known for his adventurous spirit and boundless curiosity. His grandfather, a retired sailor, often regaled him with tales of treasure maps and pirate legends. One day, Finn found an old, weathered map tucked away in a dusty corner of his grandfather's attic. The map had faded markings but clearly showed a route to Pi-Rate Island with a large ‚ÄúX‚Äù marking the spot where the treasure was buried. With his heart racing, Finn set off on a small sailboat, the ‚ÄúSea Serpent,‚Äù to uncover the secrets of Pi-Rate Island. He packed his essentials, including a compass, a rope, and a trusty spyglass, and set sail on a bright, sunny morning. The journey to Pi-Rate Island was filled with adventure, as he navigated through playful dolphins and navigated past swirling whirlpools. Upon arriving at Pi-Rate Island, Finn was greeted by a dense jungle and a maze of rocky cliffs. The island's eerie, fog-covered landscape was both enchanting and foreboding. Finn‚Äôs first challenge was to find a way through the tangled jungle. With his map and compass in hand, he ventured deeper into the island. Along the way, Finn encountered a mischievous parrot named Captain Squawk, who had been living on the island for years. Captain Squawk had a colorful plumage and a knack for riddles. ‚ÄúAhoy, young adventurer!‚Äù squawked the parrot. ‚ÄúIf ye want to find the treasure, ye must first solve me riddles!‚Äù ----- Finn was eager to prove himself. Captain Squawk perched on a branch and recited his first riddle: ‚ÄúI can fly without wings, I can cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness flies. What am I?‚Äù Finn thought hard, then answered, ‚ÄúA cloud!‚Äù The parrot fluttered in approval and revealed a hidden path. As Finn followed the path, he came across an ancient, crumbling pirate fort. The fort was filled with remnants of old battles and dusty relics. Inside, Finn discovered a faded journal belonging to the pirate captain, Blackbeard. The journal mentioned two other hidden clues needed to find the treasure: a golden compass and a secret code. Finn‚Äôs next challenge was to find the golden compass, which was rumored to be hidden in the Whispering Caves. The caves were filled with echoes and\n[Source: Small-Stories-in-English-learnenglishteam.com_.pdf, ID: Small-Stories-in-English-learnenglishteam.com__0]", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='## **The Hidden Village** Deep in the heart of an ancient forest, shrouded in mist and mystery, lay the hidden village of Whispering Pines. This magical village was known only to those who truly needed it and appeared only when the forest was in great need of help. One crisp autumn afternoon, a weary traveler named Ella wandered into the forest. She had been lost for days, her spirit dimming with each step. Just as she was about to give up hope, the forest seemed to shift and reveal a hidden path, leading her to the village. As Ella stepped into Whispering Pines, she was greeted by an awe-inspiring sight. The village was unlike anything she had ever seen: floating lanterns bobbed gently in the air, illuminating cobblestone streets lined with quaint cottages covered in vibrant flowers. The villagers‚Äîan eclectic mix of magical creatures‚Äîwelcomed her warmly. The first villager Ella met was a jovial elf named Lorian. His pointy ears twitched with excitement as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to Whispering Pines! It‚Äôs rare to see a newcomer. We‚Äôve been in need of help for a long time.‚Äù Ella noticed that the once-bustling village was now quiet and subdued. The lanterns that usually floated with a soft, warm glow were dim, and the animals that once played in the streets seemed restless. As Lorian explained, the village‚Äôs magic was fading because they had lost a precious crystal that sustained their enchantment. The crystal, called the Heartstone, had been stolen by a greedy sorcerer who sought to harness its power for himself. Without it, the village‚Äôs magic was waning, and its connection to the outside world was slowly disappearing. Determined to help, Ella set out with Lorian and his friends. The first stop was the Enchanted Forest, a mystical part of the forest filled with ancient trees and hidden paths. Ella was introduced to the village‚Äôs wise old wizard, Alaric, who had once been a guardian of the Heartstone but had lost his memory and powers after the crystal was stolen. Alaric, though frail and forgetful, gave Ella a magical compass that would guide her to the sorcerer‚Äôs lair. He also shared a clue: ‚ÄúThe Heartstone lies where shadows dance and the moonlight sings.‚Äù Ella and Lorian ventured deeper into the forest, encountering a series of magical challenges. They navigated through the Whispering Woods, where the trees whispered secrets and misdirected travelers. They befriended a mischievous sprite named Flicker who offered to guide them through the maze of thorns in exchange for a promise of friendship. Flicker led them to the Moonlit Glade, where shadows seemed to come alive. The sorcerer‚Äôs lair was hidden in a cave behind a waterfall. As they approached, Ella noticed that the cave was guarded by enchanted creatures‚Äîa giant, shimmering serpent with scales like mirrors. Ella used her wits to distract the serpent by creating illusions with her lantern and using the magical compass to find a hidden path around it. Inside the cave, she found the Heartstone atop a pedestal, glowing faintly in the dim light. ----- As Ella\n[Source: Small-Stories-in-English-learnenglishteam.com_.pdf, ID: Small-Stories-in-English-learnenglishteam.com__6]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='on a pedestal. The book was locked with a complex mechanism. Suddenly, a soft, rustling sound caught Emily‚Äôs attention. Out of the shadows emerged a glowing, ancient book named Barnaby. He floated gracefully, his cover adorned with ornate patterns and twinkling stars. ‚ÄúWelcome, Emily,‚Äù Barnaby said in a warm, echoing voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for someone with a pure heart to restore the magic. I am Barnaby, the guardian of this library.‚Äù Emily‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou know my name?‚Äù Barnaby chuckled softly. ‚ÄúI know all who seek the magic of stories. To restore the library, we must unlock the heart of its enchantment. But first, we need to navigate the challenges that have kept it hidden for so long.‚Äù Barnaby led Emily through the labyrinthine library, filled with hidden passages and secret rooms. They ventured into the Grand Gallery, a room with walls that were covered in moving paintings and glowing constellations. Each painting depicted scenes from famous stories, but they seemed frozen in time. Emily‚Äôs first challenge was to solve a puzzle to unlock a hidden door. The door was adorned with a riddle: ‚ÄúI speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?‚Äù Barnaby hovered beside her, his pages fluttering with anticipation. Emily thought deeply and answered, ‚ÄúAn echo!‚Äù The door creaked open, revealing a hidden chamber filled with old, dusty scrolls. -----\n[Source: Small-Stories-in-English-learnenglishteam.com_.pdf, ID: Small-Stories-in-English-learnenglishteam.com__2]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='the dragon‚Äôs lair and discovered that the dragon was not evil but was suffering from a curse that had made it act out. Using the gemstone, Alex broke the curse and restored peace to the kingdom. The grateful king crowned Alex a hero, and Alex returned to his world with a newfound confidence and the knowledge that bravery comes from within. **Main Idea:** True heroism comes from facing challenges with courage and a willingness to help others. ## **The Secret Garden** In a charming village, there was a neglected garden behind a tall, ivy-covered wall. The garden was once beautiful but had fallen into disrepair. A young girl named Mia, with a love for nature, decided to restore the garden. Mia spent every day working on the garden. She pruned the overgrown plants, cleared the weeds, and planted new flowers. As she worked, she discovered old garden tools and a mysterious, locked gate. One day, an elderly gardener named Mr. Green visited Mia. ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre working hard to restore the garden,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe gate you found is a magical one. It can only be unlocked with a special key that has been lost for many years.‚Äù ----- Mia was determined to find the key. She searched the village, asking for stories and clues about the garden‚Äôs past. Finally, she discovered an old diary with a description of the key‚Äôs hiding place. With the key in hand, Mia unlocked the gate and found a hidden part of the garden filled with rare and beautiful plants. She restored it to its former glory, and the village celebrated the renewed beauty of the garden. **Main Idea:** Persistence and dedication can lead to discovering hidden beauty and making a lasting impact. ## **The Mysterious Lighthouse** On a rugged coastline, there stood an old lighthouse that had been abandoned for years. A young boy named Jack, who loved exploring, was fascinated by the lighthouse. One foggy evening, he decided to investigate. As Jack climbed the lighthouse stairs, he noticed strange lights flickering in the distance. He reached the top and discovered that the lighthouse‚Äôs light was still operational but not being used. Jack met an old keeper‚Äôs ghost named Captain Bill. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for someone to help me,‚Äù Captain Bill said. ‚ÄúThe lighthouse was cursed, and its light has been lost. Only someone with a pure heart can lift the curse.‚Äù Jack agreed to help. He followed Captain Bill‚Äôs instructions to solve a series of riddles and repair the lighthouse‚Äôs mechanisms. Along the way, Jack faced various challenges: navigating through dark rooms, fixing broken parts, and decoding messages. As Jack completed each task, the lighthouse‚Äôs light grew brighter. Finally, the curse was lifted, and the lighthouse shone brightly once more, guiding ships safely to shore. Jack returned to his village, where the lighthouse became a beacon of hope and safety. He learned that courage and a pure heart could overcome even the darkest of curses. **Main Idea:** Courage and a pure heart can lift curses and bring light to even the darkest places. -----\n[Source: Small-Stories-in-English-learnenglishteam.com_.pdf, ID: Small-Stories-in-English-learnenglishteam.com__5]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='tricky paths that seemed to shift and change. Finn used his wits and the map to navigate through the caves, avoiding traps and deciphering clues etched into the walls. At the heart of the Whispering Caves, Finn found the golden compass embedded in a stone pedestal. The compass had intricate carvings and glowed faintly. With the compass in hand, Finn felt a surge of excitement. He now needed to crack the secret code mentioned in Blackbeard‚Äôs journal. Returning to the pirate fort, Finn studied the journal carefully. The secret code was hidden in a series of symbols that needed to be aligned in a specific order. Finn used the golden compass to guide him, and after several attempts, he managed to decipher the code. The final clue led Finn to a hidden chamber beneath the fort. The chamber was adorned with old treasure chests, but the true treasure was hidden behind a sliding wall. Finn used the code to unlock the wall, revealing a dazzling array of gold coins, jewels, and precious artifacts. At the center of the treasure was a beautifully crafted chest with a plaque that read: ‚ÄúTo the bravest of hearts.‚Äù As Finn marveled at the treasure, Captain Squawk appeared again, fluttering with joy. ‚ÄúYe‚Äôve done it, young adventurer! Ye‚Äôve found the lost treasure of Pi-Rate Island! But remember, true treasure is not just gold and jewels‚Äîit‚Äôs the adventure and courage ye showed.‚Äù Finn agreed, realizing that the journey itself had been as valuable as the treasure. He returned to Seaside with stories of his adventure and the lost treasure. The villagers celebrated his bravery, and Pi-Rate Island became a symbol of adventure and discovery. **Main Idea:** The true treasure lies not just in gold and jewels, but in the courage and adventure experienced along the journey. ----- ## **The Enchanted Library** In the charming village of Willowbrook, there was once a grand library known as the Enchanted Library, famous for its magical books and timeless tales. Sadly, a dark spell had sealed the library for years, leaving its wonders dormant and forgotten. Emily, a bright and adventurous girl with a love for stories, had always been captivated by the tales of the Enchanted Library. Her grandmother often spoke of its wonders, and Emily dreamed of one day exploring its mystical halls. One sunny afternoon, while rummaging through her grandmother‚Äôs attic, Emily stumbled upon a hidden compartment in an old wooden chest. Inside, she found an intricately designed key with shimmering runes and a tag that read: ‚ÄúTo awaken the magic, unlock the heart.‚Äù Excited, Emily hurried to the library. The once-majestic building was overgrown with ivy and vines. The grand wooden doors were locked tight, but Emily‚Äôs key fit perfectly. As she turned it, the doors creaked open with a magical shimmer, revealing a world of enchantment. Inside, the library was bathed in a golden glow. Dust motes danced in the air, and the shelves, though covered in cobwebs, seemed to whisper secrets.
