    "answer": "FINAL_ANSWER: Clustering in machine learning is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points based on their similarity. It's used for various purposes like market segmentation, anomaly detection, and simplifying large datasets. There are two main types of clustering: hard clustering, where each data point belongs to only one cluster, and soft clustering, where data points can belong to multiple clusters with varying probabilities. Different clustering methods include centroid-based, density-based, connectivity-based, distribution-based, and fuzzy clustering, each with its own approach to identifying and grouping data points.",
