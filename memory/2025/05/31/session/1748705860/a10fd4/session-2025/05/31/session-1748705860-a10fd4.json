In this paragraph, the writer begins with the topic of job-skills courses, but veers off onto the topic of algebra and history before returning to the subject of courses on employment.\\n- As a result, the paragraph is disjointed and difficult to understand.\\n\\n**Topic Sentence**\\n- The topic sentence is a sentence that indicates in a general way what idea or thesis the paragraph is going to deal with.\\n- Although not all paragraphs have clear-cut topic sentences, an easy way to make sure your reader understands the topic of the paragraph is to put your topic sentence near the beginning of the paragraph.\\n- Regardless of whether you include an explicit topic sentence or not, you should be able to easily summarize what the paragraph is about.\\n- Examples\\n- \"Many television cartoons contain an unhealthy amount of violence.\"\\n- Notice that this sentence clearly identifies that the key topic of the paragraph is violence in television cartoons.\\n- It also indicates that the remainder of the paragraph will discuss how much violence cartoons typically contain, and how/why this violence is unhealthy for viewers.\\n- \"An increasing number of people in America are enjoying the benefits of organically grown fruits and vegetables.\"\\n- This topic sentence indicates that the remainder of the paragraph will cover the trend in the United States toward eating organic foods.\\n- The reader can also anticipate learning more in this paragraph about the specific benefits of organic foods.\\n\\n**Adequate development**\\n- The topic (which is introduced by the topic sentence) should be discussed fully and adequately.\\n- Again, this varies from paragraph to paragraph, depending on the author\\'s purpose, but writers should be wary of paragraphs that only have two or three sentences.\\n- A good rule of thumb to follow is to make sure that a paragraph contains four to five sentences which explain and elaborate on the topic sentence.\\n- Example\\n- \"The topics of leadership and management are both similar to and different from one another in several important ways. To be effective, a manager should be a good leader. And good leaders know how to manage people effectively.\"\\n- Consider the paragraph given above.\\n- The topic sentence promises to discuss \"several\" points of comparison and contrast between leadership and management, but the remainder of the paragraph falls short of fulfilling this promise.\\n- Only one point of comparison is raised, and this point is left unexplained.\\n- Several questions remain unanswered: How are leaders different from managers? In what specific ways are the two alike? Why must a manager be a good leader to be effective? Why must good leaders know how to manage people effectively?\\n- To achieve adequate development in this paragraph, these questions should be addressed.\\n- Generally speaking, a paragraph should contain between three and five sentences, all of which help clarify and support the main idea of the paragraph.\\n- When a writer begins a new paragraph, it signals to the reader that the writer is changing thoughts or ideas, or is moving on to discuss a different aspect of a main idea.\\n- Here is an example of a paragraph of stacked sentences that lacks logical and verbal bridges:\\n- *My dogs are named Cooper and Calli. Cooper is a Golden retriever and Akita mix. He is a male. Calli is a shepherd, Husky and wolf mix. She is a female. Calli was rescued from the pound. Cooper was purchased from a breeder. They are close in age. They play together all the time.*\\n- Revised to incorporate bridges and varied sentence structure, the paragraph would read as follows:\\n- *My dogs, Cooper and Calli, are best friends. Cooper, a male retriever and Akita mix, came from a breeder. On the other hand, Calli, a shepherd, husky and wolf mix, was rescued from the pound. Because they are close in age, they play together all the time.*\\n- Still, the paragraph lacks adequate development. Adequate development is achieved through details, including facts, description, examples, quotes, analysis, explanation, and evaluation. A more developed paragraph would read like this:\\n\\n- My *dogs, Cooper and Calli, are best friends. Cooper, a male golden retriever and Akita mix, came from a breeder. On the other hand, Calli, a shepherd, husky and wolf mix, was rescued from the pound. Because they are close in age, they play together all the time. For example, the two dogs hunt for mice that are attracted*\\n\\n**Classroom Activity**\\n- Prepare a 1.5 page Personal Development Plan for the year 2024 based on SMART Goals\\n- SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely\\n- Paragraph 1: Analysis of Personal Current Situation and Development Needs\\n- Paragraph 2: Timeline of activities\\n- Paragraph 3: Summing up\\n\\nThus, classification often starts by looking at documents, and finding the significant words in those documents. Our first guess might be that the words appearing most frequently in a document are the most significant. However, that intuition is exactly opposite of the truth. The most frequent words will most surely be the common words such as \u201cthe\u201d or \u201cand,\u201d which help build ideas but do not carry any significance themselves. In fact, the several hundred most common words in English (called stop words) are often removed from documents before any attempt to classify them. In fact, the indicators of the topic are relatively rare words. However, not all rare words are equally useful as indicators. There are certain words, for example \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d or \u201calbeit,\u201d that appear rarely in a collection of documents, yet do not tell us anything useful. On the other hand, a word like \u201cchukker\u201d is probably equally rare, but tips us off that the document is about the sport of polo. The difference between rare words that tell us something and those that do not has to do with the concentration of the useful words in just a few documents. That is, the presence of a word like \u201calbeit\u201d in a document does not make it terribly more likely that it will appear multiple times. However, if an article mentions \u201cchukker\u201d once, it is likely to tell us what happened in the \u201cfirst chukker,\u201d then the \u201csecond chukker,\u201d and so on. That is, the word is likely to be repeated if it appears at all. The formal measure of how concentrated into relatively few documents are the occurrences of a given word is called TF.IDF (Term Frequency times Inverse Document Frequency). It is normally computed as follows. Suppose we have a collection of N documents. Define f ij to be the frequency (number of occurrences) of term (word) i in document j. Then, define the term frequency TF ij to be:\\nf ij\\nTF ij =\\nmax k f kj\\nThat is, the term frequency of term i in document j is f ij normalized by dividing it by the maximum number of occurrences of any term (perhaps excluding stop words) in the same document. Thus, the most frequent term in document j gets a TF of 1, and other terms get fractions as their term frequency for this document. The IDF for a term is defined as follows. Suppose term i appears in n i of the N documents in the collection. Then IDF i = log 2 (N/n i ). The TF.IDF score for term i in document j is then defined to be TF ij \u00d7 IDF i . The terms with the highest TF.IDF score are often the terms that best characterize the topic of the document.\\nExample 1.4 : Suppose our repository consists of 2 [20] = 1,048,576 documents. Suppose word w appears in 2 [10] = 1024 of these documents. Then IDF w = log 2 (2 [20] /2 [10] ) = log 2(2 [10] ) = 10.'}",
