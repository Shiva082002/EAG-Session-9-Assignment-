Being a golden retriever mix, Cooper should be more attracted to the water, but Calli is the one who is always wet from laying in the pool.\\nCooper keeps Calli active and fit with their constant play. They are truly bonded.\\n\\n**Methods to develop your paragraph**\\n- Use examples and illustrations\\n- Cite data (facts, statistics, evidence, details, and others)\\n- Examine testimony (what other people say such as quotes and paraphrases)\\n- Use an anecdote or story\\n- Define the terms used in the paragraph\\n- Compare and contrast\\n- Evaluate causes and reasons\\n- Examine effects and consequences\\n- Analyze the topic\\n- Describe the topic\\n- Offer a chronology of an event (time segments)\\n\\n**When to start a new paragraph?**\\n- When you begin a new idea or point. New ideas should always start in new paragraphs. If you have an extended idea that spans multiple paragraphs, each new point within that idea should have its own paragraph.\\n- To contrast information or ideas. Separate paragraphs can serve to contrast sides in a debate, different points in an argument, or any other difference.\\n- When your readers need a pause. Breaks between paragraphs function as a short \"break\" for your readers\u2014adding these in will help your writing be more readable. You would create a break if the paragraph becomes too long or the material is complex.\\n- When you are ending your introduction or starting your conclusion. Your introductory and concluding material should always be in a new paragraph. Many introductions and conclusions have multiple paragraphs depending on their content, length, and the writer\\'s purpose.\\n\\n**Transitions and signposts**\\n- Two very important elements of paragraphing are signposts and transitions.\\n- Signposts are internal aids to assist readers; they usually consist of several sentences or a paragraph outlining what the article has covered and where the article will be going. Signposts occur as sentences within an essay indicating to the reader how the essay is structured and how the ideas are arranged.\\n- Transitions are usually one or several sentences that \"transition\" from one idea to the next. Transitions can be used at the end of most paragraphs to help the paragraphs flow one into the next. Transitional words form a link to the previous sentence; they include words such as: also, although, likewise, however, subsequently, therefore, rather, also, again, for example.\\n\\n**5-step process to paragraph development**\\n- Step 1. Decide on a controlling idea and create a topic sentence\\n- Step 2. Explain the controlling idea\\n- Step 3. Give an example (or multiple examples)\\n- Step 4. Explain the example(s)\\n- Step 5. Complete the paragraph\u2019s idea or transition into the next paragraph\\n\\nachieve unity in this paragraph, the writer should begin a new paragraph when the switch is made from employees to managers.\\n\\n**Coherence**\\n- Coherence is the trait that makes the paragraph easily understandable to a reader.\\n- You can help create coherence in your paragraphs by creating logical bridges and verbal bridges.\\n- Logical bridges - The same idea of a topic is carried over from sentence to sentence. Successive sentences can be constructed in parallel form.\\n- Verbal bridges - Key words can be repeated in several sentences, synonymous words can be repeated in several sentences, pronouns can refer to nouns in previous sentences, transition words can be used to link ideas from different sentences.\\n- Example - \"Schools should offer courses to help students with the problems of unemployment. Such a course might begin with a discussion of where to find employment, then cover resume writing and interviewing. Algebra and history don\\'t help students with real-world needs. They are required courses that students aren\\'t interested in, and this is frustrating for students who would rather learn about other subjects. If schools offered job-skills courses, students would be well prepared for the difficult task of finding a job once they finish school.\"\\n- Consider the example given above. In this paragraph, the writer begins with the topic of job-skills courses, but veers off onto the topic of algebra and history before returning to the subject of courses on employment. As a result, the paragraph is disjointed and difficult to understand.\\n\\n**Topic Sentence**\\n- The topic sentence is a sentence that indicates in a general way what idea or thesis the paragraph is going to deal with.\\n- Although not all paragraphs have clear-cut topic sentences, an easy way to make sure your reader understands the topic of the paragraph is to put your topic sentence near the beginning of the paragraph.\\n- Regardless of whether you include an explicit topic sentence or not, you should be able to easily summarize what the paragraph is about.\\n- Examples - \"Many television cartoons contain an unhealthy amount of violence.\" This sentence clearly identifies that the key topic of the paragraph is violence in television cartoons. It also indicates that the remainder of the paragraph will discuss how much violence cartoons typically contain, and how/why this violence is unhealthy for viewers. \"An increasing number of people in America are enjoying the benefits of organically grown fruits and vegetables.\" This topic sentence indicates that the remainder of the paragraph will cover the trend in the United States toward eating organic foods. The reader can also anticipate learning more in this paragraph about the specific benefits of organic foods.\\n\\n**Adequate development**\\n- The topic (which is introduced by the topic sentence) should be discussed fully and adequately. Again, this varies from paragraph to paragraph, depending on the author\\'s purpose, but writers should be wary of paragraphs that only have two or three sentences. A good rule of thumb to follow is to make sure that a paragraph contains four to five sentences which explain and elaborate on the topic sentence.\\n- Example - \"The topics of leadership and management are both similar to and different from one another in several important ways. To be effective, a manager should be a good leader. And good leaders know how to manage people effectively.\" Consider the paragraph given above. The topic sentence promises to discuss \"several\" points of comparison and contrast between leadership and management, but the remainder of the paragraph falls short of fulfilling this promise. Only one point of comparison is raised, and this point is left unexplained. Several questions remain unanswered: How are leaders different from managers? In what specific ways are the two alike? Why must a manager be a good leader to be effective? Why must good leaders know how to manage people effectively? To achieve adequate development in this paragraph, these questions should be addressed.\\n- Generally speaking, a paragraph should contain between three and five sentences, all of which help clarify and support the main idea of the paragraph.\\n- When a writer begins a new paragraph, it signals to the reader that the writer is changing thoughts or ideas, or is moving on to discuss a different aspect of a main idea.\\n- Here is an example of a paragraph of stacked sentences that lacks logical and verbal bridges: My dogs are named Cooper and Calli. Cooper is a Golden retriever and Akita mix. He is a male. Calli is a shepherd, Husky and wolf mix. She is a female. Calli was rescued from the pound. Cooper was purchased from a breeder. They are close in age. They play together all the time.\\n- Revised to incorporate bridges and varied sentence structure, the paragraph would read as follows: My dogs, Cooper and Calli, are best friends. Cooper, a male retriever and Akita mix, came from a breeder. On the other hand, Calli, a shepherd, husky and wolf mix, was rescued from the pound. Because they are close in age, they play together all the time.\\n- Still, the paragraph lacks adequate development. Adequate development is achieved through details, including facts, description, examples, quotes, analysis, explanation, and evaluation. A more developed paragraph would read like this:* My dog\\'s, Cooper and Calli, are best friends. Cooper, a male golden retriever and Akita mix, came from a breeder. On the other hand, Calli, a shepherd, husky and wolf mix, was rescued from the pound. Because they are close in age, they play together all the time. For example, the two dogs hunt for mice that are attracted\\n\\n**Classroom Activity**\\n- Prepare a 1.5 page Personal Development Plan for the year 2024 based on SMART Goals\\n- SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely\\n- Paragraph 1: Analysis of Personal Current Situation and Development Needs\\n- Paragraph 2: Timeline of activities\\n- Paragraph 3: Summing up\\n\\nThus, classification often starts by looking at documents, and finding the significant words in those documents. Our first guess might be that the words appearing most frequently in a document are the most significant. However, that intuition is exactly opposite of the truth. The most frequent words will most surely be the common words such as \u201cthe\u201d or \u201cand,\u201d which help build ideas but do not carry any significance themselves. In fact, the several hundred most common words in English (called stop words) are often removed from documents before any attempt to classify them. In fact, the indicators of the topic are relatively rare words. However, not all rare words are equally useful as indicators. There are certain words, for example \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d or \u201calbeit,\u201d that appear rarely in a collection of documents, yet do not tell us anything useful. On the other hand, a word like \u201cchukker\u201d is probably equally rare, but tips us off that the document is about the sport of polo. The difference between rare words that tell us something and those that do not has to do with the concentration of the useful words in just a few documents. That is, the presence of a word like \u201calbeit\u201d in a document does not make it terribly more likely that it will appear multiple times. However, if an article mentions \u201cchukker\u201d once, it is likely to tell us what happened in the \u201cfirst chukker,\u201d then the \u201csecond chukker,\u201d and so on. That is, the word is likely to be repeated if it appears at all. The formal measure of how concentrated into relatively few documents are the occurrences of a given word is called TF.IDF (Term Frequency times Inverse Document Frequency). It is normally computed as follows. Suppose we have a collection of N documents. Define f ij to be the frequency (number of occurrences) of term (word) i in document j. Then, define the term frequency TF ij to be: f ij TF ij = max k f kj That is, the term frequency of term i in document j is f ij normalized by dividing it by the maximum number of occurrences of any term (perhaps excluding stop words) in the same document. Thus, the most frequent term in document j gets a TF of 1, and other terms get fractions as their term frequency for this document. The IDF for a term is defined as follows. Suppose term i appears in n i of the N documents in the collection. Then IDF i = log 2 (N/n i ). The TF.IDF score for term i in document j is then defined to be TF ij \u00d7 IDF i . The terms with the highest TF.IDF score are often the terms that best characterize the topic of the document. Example 1.4 : Suppose our repository consists of 2 [20] = 1,048,576 documents. Suppose word w appears in 2 [10] = 1024 of these documents. Then IDF w = log 2 (2 [20] /2 [10] ) = log 2(2 [10] ) = 10.'}",

Again, this varies from paragraph to paragraph, depending on the author's purpose, but writers should be wary of paragraphs that only have two or three sentences. A good rule of thumb to follow is to make sure that a paragraph contains four to five sentences which explain and elaborate on the topic sentence.\n- Example - \"The topics of leadership and management are both similar to and different from one another in several important ways. To be effective, a manager should be a good leader. And good leaders know how to manage people effectively.\" Consider the paragraph given above. The topic sentence promises to discuss \"several\" points of comparison and contrast between leadership and management, but the remainder of the paragraph falls short of fulfilling this promise. Only one point of comparison is raised, and this point is left unexplained. Several questions remain unanswered: How are leaders different from managers? In what specific ways are the two alike? Why must a manager be a good leader to be effective? Why must good leaders know how to manage people effectively?
