The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements.\\n\\nMeasures to reduce use of hazardous material: DLF has implemented a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for materials used in construction of its buildings. MSDS provides information on the potential hazards arising from chemical properties of a product including information on health effects, reactivity, storage, handling, disposal and spill/ leak procedures, enabling personnel to work safely with the chemical product.

Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system?\\nYes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division.\\nb. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?\\n- Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically.\\n- Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents.\\nc. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N).\\nYes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as:\\n- **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD. His duty is to take a round of the facility\\n\\n# Greenhouse Gas Emissions\\nProvide details of greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) and its intensity, in the following format:\\n\\n|Parameter|Unit|FY 2022-23|FY 2021-22|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Total Scope 1 emissions|Metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent|20,440.28|72,014.10|\\n|Total Scope 2 emissions|Metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent|3,28,646.33|2,51,629.45|\\n|Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions per rupee of turnover|Metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent per rupee of turnover|0.0000061|0.0000057|\\n|Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions per area of total portfolio (Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in tCOe/ area of portfolio (including total leasable and saleable area in sq. mtr.)|Metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent per square metre of portfolio (including total leasable and saleable area in sq. mtr.)|0.046|0.048|\\n\\nNote: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/ assurance has been carried out by an external agency? (Y/ N). If yes, name of the external agency. No.\\nFor data reported under Principle 6, the boundary includes all DLF\u2019s rental portfolio, hospitality portfolio and those development projects where construction was ongoing in FY 2022-23. For projects where construction was completed in FY 2021-22 (saleable properties), have not been included in this boundary. DLF continues to further strengthen its data monitoring systems for all development projects. Turnover is total revenue from operations. However, it may be noted that as per the accounting standards, the revenue of DLF Cyber City Developers Limited (DCCDL), a material subsidiary of the Company is not consolidated in the Consolidated Turnover and is accounted as a Joint Venture.\\n\\n# Waste Management Practices\\nBriefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.\\nDLF is committed to waste minimisation and promoting efficient use of resources throughout the lifecycle of construction and portfolio management. It undertakes several measures to reduce, reuse or recycle waste generated from the business activities.\\n- Project-specific plans are put in place for efficient resource use and waste recycling, prior to initiating construction. DLF also work with customers and waste disposal companies to introduce recycling systems into leases for rental buildings;\\n- Contractors engaged in construction are encouraged to recover, reuse and recycle building materials;\\n- The Company educates its employees, tenants and contractors on appropriate waste management techniques and support contractors to promote waste management awareness at its development sites, as required; and\\n- All waste generated from business activities across all operations is recycled, reused, composted, treated for energy recovery, or sent to authorized recyclers for suitable handling.\\n\\nWaste Collection, Segregation and Management\\n- It is a constant effort to ensure all generated waste is suitably treated and no waste is sent to landfill at all its sites. Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy.\\n- DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below:\\na. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping.\\nb. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants.\\nc. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements.\\n\\nMeasures to reduce use of hazardous material\\nDLF has implemented a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for materials used in construction of its buildings. MSDS provides information on the potential hazards arising from chemical properties of a product including information on health effects, reactivity, storage, handling, disposal and spill/ leak procedures, enabling personnel to work safely with the chemical product. Materials are approved and handled appropriately based on the MSDS, which helps prevent the usage of materials with any toxic content.'}",

It undertakes several measures to reduce, reuse or recycle waste generated from the business activities.\n- Project-specific plans are put in place for efficient resource use and waste recycling, prior to initiating construction. DLF also work with customers and waste disposal companies to introduce recycling systems into leases for rental buildings;\n- Contractors engaged in construction are encouraged to recover, reuse and recycle building materials;\n- The Company educates its employees, tenants and contractors on appropriate waste management techniques and support contractors to promote waste management awareness at its development sites, as required; and\n- All waste generated from business activities across all operations is recycled, reused, composted, treated for energy recovery, or sent to authorized recyclers for suitable handling.\n\nWaste Collection, Segregation and Management\n- It is a constant effort to ensure all generated waste is suitably treated and no waste is sent to landfill at all its sites. Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy.\n- DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below:\na. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping.\nb. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants.\nc. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nMeasures to reduce use of hazardous material\nDLF has implemented a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for materials used in construction of its buildings. MSDS provides information on the potential hazards arising from chemical properties of a product including information on health effects, reactivity, storage, handling, disposal and spill/ leak procedures, enabling personnel to work safely with the chemical product. Materials are approved and handled appropriately based on the MSDS, which helps prevent the usage of materials with any toxic content."
