It is an unsupervised learning method that extracts insights from unlabelled data points.\\n\\nFor example, clustering can group customers with similar shopping habits for targeted marketing, product recommendations, or customer segmentation.\\n\\nFor Example, In the graph given below, we can clearly see that there are 3 circular clusters forming on the basis of distance.\\n\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/merge3cluster.jpg]\\n\\nNow it is not necessary that the clusters formed **must be circular in shape**. The shape of clusters can be arbitrary. There are many algorithms that work well with detecting arbitrary shaped clusters.\\n\\nFor example, In the below given graph we can see that the clusters formed are not circular in shape.\\n\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/clusteringg.jpg]\\n\\n## Types of Clustering\\n\\nThere are two main types of clustering:\\n\\n**Hard Clustering:** Each data point belongs completely to one cluster.\\n| Data Points | Clusters |\\n|---|\\n| A | C1 |\\n| B | C2 |\\n| C | C2 |\\n| D | C1 |\\n\\n**Soft Clustering:** Each data point has a probability of belonging to each cluster.\\n\\n| Data Points | Probability of C1 | Probability of C2 |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| A | 0.91 | 0.09 |\\n| B | 0.3 | 0.7 |\\n| C | 0.17 | 0.83 |\\n| D | 1 | 0 |\\n\\n## Uses of Clustering\\n\\nClustering algorithms are used for:\\n\\n**Market Segmentation:** Grouping customers for targeted advertisements.\\n**Market Basket Analysis:** Determining which items are often bought together. For example, In USA, according to a study diapers and beers were usually bought together by fathers.\\n**Social Network Analysis:** Understanding browsing behavior for friend or content recommendations.\\n**Medical Imaging:** Identifying diseased areas in diagnostic images.\\n**Anomaly Detection:** Finding outliers or fraudulent transactions.\\n**Simplify working with large datasets:** Each cluster is given a cluster ID after clustering is complete.

Using the same principle, clustering data can make complex datasets simpler.\\n\\n## Types of Clustering Methods\\n\\n**Clustering helps in the analysis of unstructured data.** **Graphing, the shortest distance, and the density of the data points are a few of the elements that influence cluster formation**. Clustering determines object relatedness **based on a similarity measure**. Similarity metrics **are easier to locate in smaller sets of features and harder as the number of features increases**. Various types of clustering algorithms are:\\n\\n- Centroid-based Clustering (Partitioning methods)\\n- Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods)\\n- Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering)\\n\\n### 1. Centroid-based Clustering (Partitioning methods)\\n\\nCentroid-based clustering organizes data points around central vectors (centroids). Each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid. Generally, the similarity measure chosen for these algorithms are Euclidian distance, Manhattan Distance or Minkowski Distance.\\n\\nThe datasets are separated into a **predetermined number of clusters, and each cluster is referenced by a vector of values. When compared to the vector value, the input data variable shows no difference and joins the cluster. **\\n\\nThe major drawback is the requirement to establish the number of clusters, \"k,\" either intuitively or scientifically (using the Elbow Method) before any clustering machine learning system starts allocating the data points. Despite this limitation, it remains the most popular type of clustering due to its simplicity and efficiency.\\n\\n### 2. Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods)\\n\\nDensity-based clustering identifies clusters as areas of high density separated by regions of low density in the data space. Unlike centroid-based methods, density-based clustering **automatically determines the number of clusters and is less susceptible to initialization positions**.\\n\\n**Key Characteristics:**\\n\\n- Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters\\n- Handles noise and outliers well\\n- Excels with clusters of different sizes and shapes\\n- Ideal for datasets with irregularly shaped or overlapping clusters\\n- Effectively manages both dense and sparse data regions\\n- Focus on local density allows detection of various cluster morphologies\\n\\nThe most popular density-based clustering algorithm is DBSCAN and OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure).\\n\\n### 3. Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering)\\n\\nConnectivity-based clustering builds a **hierarchy of clusters using a measure of connectivity based on distance** when organizing a collection of items based on their similarities. This method builds a **dendrogram**, a tree-like structure that visually represents the relationships between objects.\\n\\nAt the base of the tree, each object starts as its own individual cluster. The algorithm then evaluates how similar the objects are to one another and begins merging the closest pairs of clusters into larger groups. This process continues iteratively, with clusters being combined step by step, until all objects are united into a single cluster at the top of the tree.\\n\\nThere are 2 approaches for Hierarchical clustering:\\n\\n**Divisive Clustering: **It follows a top-down approach, here we consider all data points to be part one big cluster and then this cluster is divide into smaller groups.\\n**Agglomerative Clustering: **It follows a bottom-up approach, here we consider all data points to be part of individual clusters and then these clusters are clubbed together to make one big cluster with all data points.** **\\n\\nFor implementing and understand difference between both techniques , please refer to : Agglomerative clustering and Divisive clustering\\n\\nTill now, we have understood **traditional \\\\\\\\\"hard\\\\\\\\\" clustering methods**, where each data point is assigned to exactly one cluster. These methods, like K-Means and hierarchical clustering, are powerful and widely used, but they have limitations when dealing with ambiguous or overlapping data. After learning all about hard clustering methods we can addresses these limitations with **soft clustering that** allows data points to belong to **multiple clusters simultaneously**, with varying degrees of membership. This approach is particularly useful when the boundaries between clusters are not clear-cut or when data points exhibit characteristics of more than one group.\\n\\nTwo of the most popular soft clustering techniques are:\\n\\n### 4. Distribution-based Clustering\\n\\nDistribution-based clustering assumes **data points are generated from a mixture of probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, etc.)**. The goal is to identify clusters by estimating the parameters of these distributions.\\n\\n- Each cluster is represented by a probability distribution.\\n- Data points are assigned to clusters based on how likely they are to belong to each distribution.\\n- Unlike distance-based methods (e.g., K-Means), this approach can capture clusters of varying shapes, sizes, and densities.\\n\\nMany real-world datasets, such as sensor data, financial data, or biological measurements, naturally follow statistical distributions. The most popular distribution-based clustering algorithm is Gaussian Mixture Model.\\n\\n### 5. **Fuzzy Clustering **\\n\\nFuzzy clustering allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.\\n\\n- Each data point is assigned a membership value between 0 and 1 for every cluster.\\n- These membership values indicate the degree to which a data point belongs to a particular cluster.\\n\\nPlease refer to fuzzy clustering methods for in-depth understanding.
